    Returns a list of (all) stored completed Spray Tasks and Sprays with Spray Measurements.
    With the optional parameter `Box2d`, only the completed Spray Tasks that intersect the given bounding box will be returned.
    With the parameters `Limit` and `Offset` it can be specified, which data to return.
    If the operation was successful (status code `200`), an array with Sprays will be returned.

    Adds either a new Spray Task or a new Spray with Spray Measurements to the completed collection.
    In the request body you have to add either the new Spray Task or the new Spray with Spray Measurements, which to be added.
    If the operation was successful (status code `200`), the numeric ID of the new Spray will be returned.
    Note: All Sprays with the same ID - as the ID specified here in the request body - are removed from the list of scheduled Spray Tasks!
