    In the request body you have to add either the new Harvest Task or the new Harvest with Harvest Measurements, which to be added.
    If the operation was successful (status code `200`), the numeric ID of the new Harvest will be returned.
    Note: All Harvests with the same ID - as the ID specified here in the request body - are removed from the list of scheduled Harvest Tasks!
