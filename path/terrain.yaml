# PATCH
# If the operation PATCH comes here, you can use the links parameter below.
# You just have to comment it out and place it in the successful response (status code "200").
# No other links have to be added in other operations.
# Have fun!

# But attention!!
#   Maybe it is possible (if the patching fails, because the TerrainId isn't found) to take the patched data and pass it to the POST in terrain_index.yaml.
#   An example for that exists for the PATCH of field.
# Have fun!
