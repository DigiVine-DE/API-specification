  description: >
    Returns a list of (all) stored climate measurements.
    If the `DeviceId` parameter is specified, only measurements from the given device are returned.
    With the parameters `Limit` and `Offset` it can be specified, which data to return.
    If the operation was successful (status code `200`), an array with Fields will be returned.
