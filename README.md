# DigiVine - Datawarehouse - API Specification

In this repo the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification for the DigiVine data warehouse API is available.

With this specification you can easily write clients that can communicate with our data warehouse.

It is split into multiple components for better maintainability.
As this is not supported by most systems, we also provide a bundled version in the `bundled` directory.
